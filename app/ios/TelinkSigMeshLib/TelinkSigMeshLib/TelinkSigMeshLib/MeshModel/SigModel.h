 5.1.4 Scheduler
 5.1.4.1 Scheduler overview
 Scheduler provides a means of autonomous change of states of a
 device based on the notion of UTC time and the ISO 8601 calendar
 [15] and a register of defined time points with associated state-
 changing actions. For example, a lamp may automatically turn off
 every day at 2AM, or a coffee machine may make coffee at 6:30AM.
 The scheduler is based on a register (see Section 5.1.4.2) that
 is capable of storing up to sixteen scheduled entries, each
 containing a starting point in local time, that may include values
 that represent multiple values, and an associated action to perform.
 */
/// The Schedule Register state is a 16-entry, zero-based, indexed array of 76-bit values
/// formatted as Scheduled Time. Each entry represents a state-changing event. Time and
/// date fields represent local time.
/// @note   - seeAlso: Mesh_Model_Specification v1.0.pdf (page.139),
/// 5.1.4.2 Schedule Register.
/// @note   The Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, and Second fields represent local time (i.e.,
/// after the TAI-UTC Delta and Time Zone Offset have been applied). The fields have the
/// meaning defined in ISO 8601 [15] (which replicates the "Gregorian" calendar in common
/// use). Some of these values can either represent an exact value or a range of values when
/// the scheduled action is performed.
/// @note   The minute and second field values have an enumerated value that represents ‘at
/// a random’ value. This scheduled action shall be triggered once within the corresponding
/// hour or minute.
/// @note   5.1.4.2.1 Schedule Register behavior
/// When the current time is known to the device, which is indicated by a value of the TAI
/// Seconds state (see Section 5.1.1.1) that is greater than zero, the entries in the Schedule
/// Register are tracked. If there is a match between the Time state (see Section 5.1.1) and
/// an entry in the Schedule Register, a corresponding Action indicated by the values in the
/// Action and Scene fields shall be executed.
/// @note   Note:A recommended implementation of the Scheduler should calculate the value
/// of the TAI Seconds (see Section 5.1.1.1) of the next scheduled event and put it in a queue
/// of scheduled events sorted by time. Every second, the first event in the queue is compared
/// with the value of the Time state (see Section 5.1.1). The first event is executed if it is less than
/// or equal to the Time state and then removed from the queue. After execution, the Repeat Flag
/// shall be checked, and the next occurrence of the scheduled event is calculated and put in the
/// queue.
