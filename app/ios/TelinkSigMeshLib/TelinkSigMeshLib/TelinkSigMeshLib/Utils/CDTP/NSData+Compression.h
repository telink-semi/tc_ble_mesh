/// This method will apply the gzip deflate algorithm and return the compressed data.
/// The compression level is a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0,
///with 0.0 meaning no compression and 1.0 meaning maximum compression.
///A value of 0.1 will provide the fastest possible compression. If you supply a negative value,
///this will apply the default compression level, which is equivalent to a value of around 0.7.
